              At preline, our mission has always been focused on bringing
              openness and transparency to the design process. We've always
              believed that by providing a space where designers can share
              ongoing work not only empowers them to make better products, it
              also helps them grow.

            As we've grown, we've seen how Preline has helped companies such as
            Spotify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Facebook, and Intercom bring their
            designers closer together to create amazing things. We've also
            learned that when the culture of sharing is brought in earlier, the
            better teams adapt and communicate with one another.

              transformative open communication can be. Now you can have a team
              of one or two designers and unlimited spectators (think PMs,
              management, marketing, etc.) share work and explore the design
              process earlier.

            Small teams and individual designers need a space where they can
            watch the design process unfold, both for themselves and for the
            people they work with â€“ no matter if it's a fellow designer, product
            manager, developer or client. Preline allows you to invite more
            people into the process, creating a central place for conversation
            around design. As those teams grow, transparency and collaboration
            becomes integrated in how they communicate and work together.
